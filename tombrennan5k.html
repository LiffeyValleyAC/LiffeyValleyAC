			<td>I started running on my own in 2012 and and gradually worked up to about 6kms, twice a week. After 2 years I had not run a PB and wanted to try longer distances. After doing my first half marathon I knew that I still needed to work on my speed. I decided to join a club despite the fact that I felt intimidated at the prospect. In 2018, after I had just joined I ran a 5km race in 25:08 and a year later ran the same race and got a time of 21:34. I have also done a marathon since then and often race for the club.</td>

			<td>I joined the club in 2006, when I was in college and training for my first running event ever – the Dublin Marathon. I ran with the club for about 3 years back then but when I started working in 2009 my hours were very long and I had to travel a lot so I lost touch with running for a few years. I dipped in and out of the club throughout that time but I’ve been back training seriously again with Liffey Valley for the past 3 or 4 years.</td>
