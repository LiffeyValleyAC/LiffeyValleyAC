### Local Development

You should have the following version of `ruby` and `gem` installed.
- ruby `>2.50` (working on windows with `2.6.8)
- gem (working on windows with `3.0.3.1`) 

To run the site locally, for testing, you can install the required libraries with:

```
script/bootstrap
```

Then run the server with:

```
script/server
```

By default, this will serve the page on http://127.0.0.1:4000 after building it.
