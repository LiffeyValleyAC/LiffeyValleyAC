LVAC 2016 Road Race Champions crowned
---

Liffey Valley AC were racing our annual club road race championships on Sunday 18 September, with Peter Arthur winning the men's 10k and Sile Carroll the women's 5k. 

Both athletes also achieved the notable feat of winning the championship (first to cross finish line) and the Memorial Trophy handicap races, and were presented with the Myles Cullen and George Harrison trophies afterwards at an enjoyable social in Gaeilscoil Inse Choir. 

We were joined today by the Cullen and Harrison families, (and lots of smaller Liffey Valley-Ers too) for a day to celebrate fond memories of Myles and George, race hard with our clubmates, and share friendships. A good day for all.
