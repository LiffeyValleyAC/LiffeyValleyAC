title: National 10k Road Championships
location: Phoenix Park, Dublin

It was a disappointing end to this race as it ended up being 1.4k short, due to issues on the course during the race. Despite this, there were fine performances from our Women and Men, albeit 8.6k with an unplanned uphill after Mary's hospital. 

The 10k championship will be re-planned for a later date.

Great to see so many Liffey Valley AC athletes competing at a national championship and much thanks also for the fantastic support from LVAC Coaches and Members around the course.
