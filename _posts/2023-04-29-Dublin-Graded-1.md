It was a great start to a new track season on the brand track in Belfield, University College Dublin.Congratulations to the LVAC athletes who competed and took the chance to try out one of Dublin's newest tracks. 

We had plenty of PBs and some track debuts. Looking forward to getting stronger and faster as the season progresses.
