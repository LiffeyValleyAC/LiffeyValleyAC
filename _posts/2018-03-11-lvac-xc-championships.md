Sile Carroll and Peter Arthur retained their respective titles in mild and relatively calm
conditions in the Phoenix Park on Sunday. The going was soft in parts of the course due to
the recent heavy snow. The combined start of the 5k womens and 8k mens races provided an
opportunity for some interesting battles throughout the field.

For Sile it was her third consecutive title and she covered the 5k in 19m33s, good running
in the conditions with Aileen Gittens second in 20m28s and her sister Annie third in 21m54s.
Orla Gordon and Aoife Brady had their usual battle for the next places and Bridget Reilly ran
her first ever cross country race in 6th place.

There were some interesting battles for the next places but up front Peter continued on his
way to retain the title in 26m02s ahead of Bogdan in 28m07s with Chris third in 28m58s. There
were some battles throughout the field with winter league points up for grabs.
