title: A Fantasic Summer of Medals and Personal Bests. Onto the Cross Country.
---

<p>The work done during winter and spring delivered rewards at the <a href="https://graded.dublinathletics.com/fixtures.php "target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dublin Athletics Graded Track and Field series</a> with many personal bests delivered across the 8 meetings. More importantly, it was great to see such high participation from LVAC Athletes from both Women and Men squads. Check out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/liffeyvalleyac/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to see highlights from across the various track meetings.</p> 

<p>On the Road, medals were secured across many categories, both Individual and Team. A highlight is <b>Tom O'Connor </b><a href="/news/2022/07/10/WMA-Half-Marathon/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">winning Team Gold (M60) at the World Masters Half Marathon in Finland.</a></p>

<p>With the Irish Summer staying on a little longer in August, warm weather training continues as focus turns to building up for the Cross Country season, with plenty of road races for August and September. We are looking forward to our club races on September 18th which remember our clubmates <b>George Harrison</b> and <b>Myles Cullen</b>.</p>
