Congratulations to all our athletes who competed in St. Anne's Park, Raheny in what was a very competitive masters championship. This was also the inaugral Pat Hooper Cup Trophy, with Liffey Valley scoring 9th of 20 Dublin Clubs who came out strongly to remember Pat.

Well done to Una Reilly and Tom O'Connor who both won individual gold in their categories, Lea Fulcher who won silver and to our M50 team who brought home bronze medals.

It was great to see so many Liffey Valley athletes competing at the championships today and of course to have plenty of support around the course, including having the tent available.

Next stop is Dunboyne for Leinster Intermediate & Masters XC.
