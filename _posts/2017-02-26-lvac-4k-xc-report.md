Tommy Breheny used his handicap to good effect to win the 4k Cross Country
Race some 15 seconds clear of Tony Dunne with Daniel English holding off
the fast finishing Damien Cauvet who recorded the day’s fastest time.

With winds reaching 100 km an hour and an orange weather warning issued by
the Met. Office the 1k lap in the very open Papal Cross area provided a
challenge for all the runners.

At least the underfoot conditions were dry which compensated to some small
degree for gale force winds as Ruth Murphy running off the limit got
proceedings underway. Ruth led the field through the first of the four
laps with Clare Kavanagh, Maeve Walsh, and Daniel English resplendent in
Blue Wooley hat and Joe Cooper making some progress.

By halfway Tommy Breheny was running strongly as he overhauled some of the
early markers. Tony Dunne was also making progress as were some of those
in the middle of the handicap.

Fifteen seconds was the margin of Tommy’s victory his second in the Winter
League whilst Tony Dunne overhauled a few to finish second ahead of Daniel
English with virtual scratch man Damian Cauvet, who had the satisfaction
of recording the fastest time, next.

With winter league points available for all the intensity of the competition
was in evidence as Eddie McGrath, Aileen Gittens and Maeve Walsh could not
be separated on the clock as they contested 13th, 14th, and 15th.

With two more races to go including the ever popular Avondale Cup 4 mile on
March 12th, the scene is set for a very competitive race on the two lap
road circuit.
