Our next Winter League race takes place tomorrow morning at 11am, starting at the dog pod (opposite the zoo.) Thankfully the forecast looks set to be much better than last year! The warm up will leave the clubhouse at 10.15. Please arrive before this to get your number and don't forget your singlet! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow! 💪🏼🏃‍♀🏃🏽
