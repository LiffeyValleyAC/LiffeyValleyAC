We had a great turn out today for the second race of our Winter League in the Phoenix Park.

The weather was milder than in recent days but the underfoot conditions were still a little mucky on the 5km XC course. 

Bernard O'Sullivan took home top points in the handicap race with Tom Breheny in 2nd and David Carroll in 3rd. 

David Carroll was the fastest man and Mollie O'Donnell the fastest woman on the day. 

Congratulations to all our athletes! Looking forward to the Club XC Championships in a few weeks time. 

Thank you as always to our officials for organising.
