Race 2 of the Winter League 2015/2016

The 2nd race of the 2015/2016 Winter League series saw the club use a course
near the Papal Cross. Favourable weather conditions & fast, flat course made
for good racing. Denise Nic Gearailt won on her debut race, and strong runs
from Ruth Murphy and Joe Cooper filling the other podium spots.  

Well done to all athletes competing
