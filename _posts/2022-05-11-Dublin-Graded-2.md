title: Dublin Athletics Graded Meeting 2 
---
Last Wednesday night a group of athletes competed over 1500 in the second Dublin graded meet of the season. The conditions were good despite a few showers and we had several PBs over the distance. In total we had 6 women and 8 men competing.

Thanks as always to the officials for organising and the supporters for cheering us on.
