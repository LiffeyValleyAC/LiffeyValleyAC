A good field of 23 signed up for the second race in the Winter League series which was a 4K
Open Handicap Cross Country race. First person off was Stephen Coughlan on go with Clare
Kavanagh on 45 seconds next to go. Aoife Brady and Luke Ryder followed on as the rest
of the field got underway with Scratch man Neil O'Rourke starting at 5 mins 45 seconds.

The lead changed a number of times before a group which included Anthony McMahon,
Daniel English and Michael Ferreira gathered at the front to dominate the race entering the
last of the four laps. McMahon forced himself clear with 800 to go and held on to win with
a six seconds gap to English in second place and a further six seconds to Ferreira who finished
in third spot.

Sile Carroll had a great battle with top masters athlete Tom O Connor to finish in 7th place
and fastest woman on the day. Neil O'Rourke who was the last man off showed a good return to
form and moved through the pack to finish strongly in 11th place and also record the fastest run
of the day with a time of 13 mins 10 secs.

Nest race in the series is the Club Cross Country Championships in March which includes a sealed
handicap for winter League points
