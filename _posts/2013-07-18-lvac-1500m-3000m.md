Leona O’Reilly won the womens 1500 mtrs and Ciaran Reilly the mens 3000mtrs in very hot conditions in ALSAA on Thursday July 18th.

Leona set out with serious intent having been beaten by Siobhan in the 800 mtrs a few weeks ago and she took it along at the front at a brisk steady pace. On the third lap she disposed of Siobhan’s challenge and went on to win in a championship best performance of 4m55s with Siobhan setting a new p.b. of 5m00 and  Sile also running faster than ever with 5m22s. Lena Sinclair made a return to competition in 4th place with Eimear Nic an Bhaird and Aileen Gittens making their track debuts.

Ciaran Reilly retained his mens 3000 title and was among the early leaders as Eddie McGrath, Arnaud Benjacar, Paul Balfe and Peter Arthur pulled away from the remainder of the field. Eddie and Arnaud took the lead at different stages of the race but Ciaran’s superior pace took him away from his pursuers over the last 400 to win in 9m31s with Arnaud getting up for second ahead of Eddie .There were quite a few p.b.’s and some great individual battles throughout the field.
