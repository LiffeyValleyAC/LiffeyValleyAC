We had a huge turnout for our annual Christmas Cake race today with almost perfect conditions in the Phoenix Park.

Congratulations to our winner Mary Ellen Ryan who lead from gun to tape in her first ever XC race. Well done also to Joe Cooper on his second place finish and Declan Connor on his third place finish. 

Well done to all our athletes for getting out and racing.
