title: Dublin Athletics Graded Meeting 4

Graded Meet no. 4 took place in sunny Santry and it was a great night of racing for the club with Mollie, Sergei and Mark all winning their races and plenty of others running season and personal bests. Well done all! 

Thanks as always to the officials for organising and the supporters for cheering us on.
