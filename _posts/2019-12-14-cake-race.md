Congratulations to David Staunton who took home the cake this year. He
finished reasoably comfortably ahead of Tommy Brehany with Tom Forde
completing the podium placings.

Fastest of the men was Peter Arthur in 16:00 while fastest woman was
Sile Carroll in 19:55. Great running in blustery conditions with under
foot conditions slightly sticky given the amount of rainfall in recent 
weeks.

As always, there were some terrific battles throughout the field with
less than a minute separating 11th through 24th places. Next race in the
winter league is the 4k cross country race. As always, it would be great
to see a good turnout on what is typically a great opportunity to pick
up valuable points.

Thank you to everyone who competed and great to see a few new members
making their cross country debuts!
