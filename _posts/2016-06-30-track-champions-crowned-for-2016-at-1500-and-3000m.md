Title: Track Champions Crowned For 2016 At 1500 And 3000m
Location: ALSAA Track
---

Peter Arthur won the 3000 metres and Aileen Gittens the 1500 metres on a cool
evening at ALSAA on June 30th. In a relatively strong cool breeze times were
not of the essence but a number of PB's were set.

Aileen set about dominating the race from the start and moved quickly into the
lead followed by Eimear and Annie. She continued at the front and had some 8
seconds to spare on Eimear who also pulled away from Annie over the last 500
metres. Denise and Linda had quite a battle with Denise edging ahead over the
last lap. Christine, Ruth and Eileen were separated by small margins.

Peter set about retaining his title in quite a positive way taking it along at
the front with Damian for company in the early stages. By the half way mark
Peter had moved clear of Damian and Arnoud was in the bronze medal position
ahead of Chris. There quite a few battles throughout the field with a number
making their debut over the distance.

Peter’s winning time of 8m49s replicated his time of last year as he retained
his title with Damian recording a PB in second clocking 9m00s and Arnoud won
bronze.
