title: Training During Covid Restrictions
---

Reminder to all members that group training is temporarily suspended during the 
current Covid restrictions. Coaches will send out training details via WhatsApp.
As per the restrictions, members can arrange to meet up in pairs to train.

With a bit of luck we will be able to resume group training in early December!
