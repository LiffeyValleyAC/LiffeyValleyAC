title: Womens Team Third in Dublin Senior Cross Country Championships
location: Tymon North, Dublin 24
---

The women’s team finished third in the Dublin Senior Championships over 6k on the rolling hills of Tymon North on Sunday November 1st.
In conditions more like Summer than Autumn, Leona O’Reilly led the field up a testing hill from the start.
The positioning of the hill so near the start meant athletes were under pressure from an early stage.

Crusaders with three in the first six from an early stage looked set to retain the team title and Donore and Liffey Valley were involved in a tight battle for silver and bronze with Sile Carroll, Aileen Gittens and Eimear Nic An Bhaird matching strides with the Donore scorers.

Caroline Crowley was a very impressive winner and led her Crusaders team home.
Leona O’Reilly was the first of the Liffey Valley girls to finish in 7th, followed by Aileen Gittens in 13th, on her last appearance for the team for some time before her taking off on her “World Tour”.
Sile Carroll was next in 17th after quite a battle with Eimear Nic An Bhaird who was the fourth scorer.
Lena Sinclair was next in 24th and Siobhan Keenehan 28th, both contributing to the team by finishing ahead of the other team's scoring athletes. 

This was the first time a Liffey Valley Women’s team have won a team medal in The Dublin Senior Championships and this performance augurs well for the remainder of the season.

The men’s team finished 6th, led home by Peter Arthur in 15th, followed by Darren Spring and Chris Morgan.
