Congratulations to our women's team who finished a fantastic 3rd Team in the Dublin Intermediate XC Championships. 

Great racing by all nine of our athletes in a cold Tymon Park today. They all showed true XC team spirit in fighting for every place. 

Well done also to our men's team who were in action today at the Dublin Intermediate XC Championships in Tymon Park. The six strong team finished in 8th position in a very competitive field.
