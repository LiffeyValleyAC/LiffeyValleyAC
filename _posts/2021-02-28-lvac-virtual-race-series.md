In the absence of club sessions or our club winter league, the club will be holding
a virtual race series (with prizes!) for all members to help keep us motivated. There
will be 3 races (5km, 4 mile and a 2 mile). It would be great to see as many members
as possible participate in this virtual club event. It's a great way to keep us sharp
and ready for a return to races.

| Event | Distance | Date          |
| ----- | -------- | ------------- |
| 1     | 5k       | Sat 6th March |
| 2     | 4 mile   | Sat 3rd April |
| 3     | 2 mile   | Sat 1st May   |

Coaches will send out training plans that are tailored towards running the virtual race
on the Saturday. However, if you are unable to run on the Saturday you can complete the
event at any time from the Thursday before the event to the Monday after.
