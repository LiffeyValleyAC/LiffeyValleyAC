Well done to our women's team on a fantastic 4th place finish at the Dublin Novice Championships in Tymon Park in unseasonably warm temperatures. This was our largest women's team in a number of years with many of our athletes competing in cross-country for the first time. 

Congratulations also to our men's team on their 6th place finish. It was great to see so many men donning the singlet and battling it out for places in a very competitive race.

Well done to all!
