title: LVAC 800m Track Championships
location: Lucan, Dublin

We had a great turn out at our club championships on Wednesday night in Lucan. The club championships offer a great chance for our newer athletes to compete on the track for the first time whilst also pushing our more seasoned track athletes to new PBs and give everyone an opportunity to compete for a medal.

Well done again to all our athletes, coaches and officials on a great night of racing.
