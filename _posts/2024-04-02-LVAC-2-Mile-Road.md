Last night we had our 2 mile handicap road race with 34 men and women competing - Heather Browning was first home tonight, with Ruth Murphy and Jeanne Nicollier 2nd and 3rd respectively, followed by a swarm of Liffey Valley clubmates as the handicaps unwound on lap 2 of the Polo Grounds circuit. 

Well done everyone who raced, and thanks to everyone who helped make the race happen smoothly.
