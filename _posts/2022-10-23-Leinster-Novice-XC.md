Congratulations to our Novice XC teams who made the trip to Louth today to compete in the Leinster Novice XC Championships today in what can only be described as proper cross country conditions!

Both teams finished 12th in very competitive fields.

Thank you as always to Tom for putting up the tent and for all the supporters along the course.
