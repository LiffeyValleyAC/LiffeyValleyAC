Thurday evenings in ALSAA seem to be reserved for either wind or rain this
summer and last Thursday (July 13th) was no exception as a strong breeze did
not help athletes in both the women’s 1500 and the men’s 3000.

Sile Carroll had a gun to tape win the women’s 1500 as she had a 4 second
margin on Aileen Gittens with her sister Annie back in action after injury
a little short of her p.b. in third place ahead of Ciara Broderick Farrell who was
also back in action after completing her medical exams.

In the men’s 3000 Peter Arthur had Damien Cauvet for company up to 2k. but
once Peter accelerated Damian was unable to respond and he had to settle for
second ahead of guest Neil O’Rourke with Gaetan Le Page taking the bronze
medal with a p.b.
