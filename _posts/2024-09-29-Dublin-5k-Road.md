Congratulations to Pierce who ran a personal best time of 15.10 to finish 2nd in the M40 category, leading the senior team to 4th place, just 4 secs off team bronze. 

Well done to all to ran in Rathfarnam as the Dublin Championships were incorporated in the historic Rathfarnam 5k. It was great to see so many personal bests achieved also.
