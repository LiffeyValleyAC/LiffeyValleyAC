A large group from the club travelled to Paris this weekend to compete in the Paris Marathon. It was a first marathon for many of the athletes and they all did the club proud with some great performances and plenty of PBs. 

Missing from picture is one of our newest members Nadia Oussarghin who travelled to her home city to run the marathon in a time of 6:31:25. 

Congratulations to all our athletes on a great weekend of racing.
