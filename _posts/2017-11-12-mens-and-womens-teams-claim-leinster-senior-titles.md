location: Adamstown, Co. Wexford

It was a great day for Liffey Valley in Adamstown Co. Wexford on Sunday (Nov.12th)
when both women’s and men’s team won the senior club titles.

With a chilly breeze blowing and some muddy patches together with a couple of hills
it was the first real cross country test of the season. The women were first in action
in defence of their team title and Eimear and Sile settled into the first ten with the
early pace being set by Siofra O’Flaherty of St. L.O’Toole but she was to pay for her
youthful enthusiasm as the race progressed fading to third after having a lead of some
30 metres on the first lap.

It was obvious to those watching that placings were of the essence in the battle for the
team title. Eimear led the team home in 10th place with Sile next in 13th. Aileen was
16th followed by Annie in 21st and Jenifer battling with scoring members of teams in 37th.  

Our score of 60 points was two ahead of Sli Cualainn on 62 with Dunboyne third on 71. The
old mantra of every place being vital was real as all team members gained places on the
final lap of what was a testing 5k.

The women’s team have quite a record in this event since winning the Novice and Intermediate
titles in 2013, moving up to win silver in the senior in 2014, going one better in 2015 and
gold in 2016 and now in 2017 retaining their title.

The men’s race over 10k presented a challenge with hills and some mud to test the athletes.
When the race settled down after one lap Kilkenny’s Thomas Hayes made his intentions clear
as he moved to the front and Peter Arthur and Neil O’Rourke settled into the chasing bunch
and set a firm foundation for what turned out to be a team victory with Raheny providing the
challenge.

Peter ran a fine race to finish second with Neil O’Rourke, having his best run ever just
losing out on the last lap for the third spot, in 4th. Mike McCarthy 14th and Chris Morgan
22nd completing the scoring four. Pierce Geoghegan (36th), Paul Balfe (50th), Andy Nason
(55th), Brendan Beere (64th), and Matt Blyth (66th) all made a contribution to the team
effort.
