Raheny’s Daire Bermingham, home from Switzerland for the Christmas period, was third in 15:35.
Cold and blustery conditions greeted the runners on the Furze Road for the 2 lap race with the final km on Chesterfield Avenue into a strong headwind.

Crusaders’ Caroline Crowley, part of the women’s team that won bronze at the European Cross Country Championships. was a clear winner in the women’s race in 16:42 ahead of Ciara Hickey (Bros Pearse) in second in 17:45 and Rachael Smyth (St Coca’s) third in 17:54.

The men’s race saw a lead pack of 5 charge off from the start with Clonliffe Harriers’ junior Cathal Doyle and Peter Arthur (Liffey Valley) up with the top three finishers with Coghlan doing much of the leading on the first circuit. It was much of the same on the second loop with Coghlan having the superior gears in the finish to get the better of St Malachy’s Ben Branagh who surprised in second.

The road season will get off in earnest now with the Waterford half marathon next week with all roads leading to Raheny on January 31st for the Raheny 5.
