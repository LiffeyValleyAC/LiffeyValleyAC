Congratulations to *Leona* & *Tom* who are this years Cross Country Champions.
The race was held on a bright, cool, windy and dry spring day, with underfoot
conditions very good and much easier than last week's National Inter
& Masters XC in Lough Key.

Thanks to *Kathryn, Tom, Dermot, Paddy, Jim, Paul & Malcolm* who officiated the
race and who made sure the races ran smoothly.

Lots of encouragement from the supporters too, so thanks to all, especially
*Tom's, Caoimhe and Charlie :-)*
