Hardly an ideal day for racing in the Phoenix Park with 10 Liffey Valley AC athletes braving the conditions, a few words from Orla Gordon for the amazing support provided by LVAC Teammates around the course.

"Thanks everyone for the unreal support today! I lost track of all the cheers I got along the way. The LV train was the envy of all the other clubs, pushed us all the way!"
