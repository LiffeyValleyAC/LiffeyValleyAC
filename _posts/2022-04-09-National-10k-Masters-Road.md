title: Gold for LVAC M50 Team in National 10k Road Championships
location: Phoenix Park, Dublin
---

On April 9th, it was a fantastic day in the Phoenix Park for the Great Ireland Run incorporating the National 10km Championships. We had some medalists and lots of PBs! 

We had two individual medalists:
ðŸ¥‡M60 Tom O Connor
ðŸ¥ˆM50 Arnaud Benjacar

Our M50 took home gold with Tom O Connor, Arnaud Benjacar and Paul Balfe scoring in the team. 

Lea Fulcher, Rachel Murphy and Brigid Reilly also put in strong performances on a tough course.

Well done to all! Great to see so many Liffey Valley AC athletes competing at a national championship.
