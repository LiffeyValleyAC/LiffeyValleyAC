title: Dublin Athletics Graded Meeting 3

Another great night's racing at the 3rd Graded Meet of the season. 

We had one winner, some PBs and lots of SBs over 800m on a windy night in Tallaght. 

Well done to all our athletes on a great nice of racing! 
Thanks as always to the organisers and officials.
