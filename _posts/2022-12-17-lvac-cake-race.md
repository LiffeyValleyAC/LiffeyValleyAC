We had a great day at our annual Cake Race today in the Phoenix Park! The conditions were perfect for racing, the sun was shing and the ground was firm underfoot. 

We had a fantastic turn out with 31 of our athletes taking part. We had a close finish and plenty of in race rivalries as always with our handicapped races. It was Rebecca McLoughlin who was victorious and had 19 seconds to spare over Patrick Fox in 2nd, with Brendan Beere taking 3rd.

Well done to all our athletes and a big thank you to our officials!
