ðŸ¥‰Dublin Intermediate BronzeðŸ¥‰

Congratulations to our senior men's team on their third place finish in the Dublin Inter XC Championships in Tymon Park. With every place counting, our total of 76 points was just enough to edge out Raheny Shamrocks AC (78 pts) in 4th and Donore Harriers AC (79) in 5th.

Congratulations also to our women's team on their strong performance as they battled it out for every place to finish 5th.

So many thanks for the LVAC Supporters around the course who gave our 11 women and 13 men the necessary encouragement to gain those extra places and points on a tough course.
