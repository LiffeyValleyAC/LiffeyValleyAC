title: LVAC Cake Race

Congratulations to Hillary McDonnell who took home the cake this year. She ended a fairly comfortable winner by
nearly half a minute from Joe Cooper with Matt Blyth in 3rd.

Fastest of the men was Peter Arthur in 15:45 while fastest woman was Aileen Gittens in 20:34. Peter matched his
time from last year, which is notable given the blustery conditions.

There were some great battles throughout the field with less than a minute separating 4th through 21st places,
hopefully a good sign for the remaining winter league races. Next race is up on the 19th of January in the 4k
cross country race. As always, it would be great to see a good turnout on what is typically a great opportunity
to pick up valuable points.
