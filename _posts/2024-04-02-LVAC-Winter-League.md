title: The LVAC 2024 Winter League Champion is Alex Du Marquez
---
Congratulations to <b>Alex Du Marquez</b> who is the winner of our Winter League. Alex had 4 points to spare over <b>John Tuohy</b> and managed this even without a 10 point bonus for racing all 5 races. 

The Winter League is an aggregation of the best 4 of 5 races in our series, which starts with the Cake Race in December and concludes with the 2 Mile Road Race in April. Those who finish all 5 races in the series are awarded a bonus of 10 points, while their worst scoring race is not counted.  

Congratulations to <b>John</b> and <b>Cormac Long</b> who finished second and third respectively.

Well done to all 58 athletes who competed in at least one of our league races this year. 

As always thank you to our coaches and officials who made it all possible.
