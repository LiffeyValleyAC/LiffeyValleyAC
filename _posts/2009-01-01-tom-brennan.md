Raheny's Richie Corcoran won the Tom Brennan Memorial 5k Road Race in the
Phoenix Park on Thursday, finishing 25 seconds clear of Crusaders' Alan
O'Brien, with Paul Fleming from Rathfarnham in third place. Azmeri Gebrejci,
making a return to action, won the women's race ahead of her sister and DCH
clubmate Tekea, with Lucy Darcy of Sportsworld in third spot.

Corcoran, who last year completed a scholarship at Villanova University, was
five seconds outside James Nolan's course record and looked like a man who
could have run faster again. 

For Azmeri Gebrejci it was a welcome return to competition after a long absence
through injury and she looked quite relaxed as she ran alongside her younger
sister for most of the way.

Over 300 runners got the New Year underway in ideal conditions on the flat two
lap course.
