Congratulations to both our men and women's teams on very strong 5th place finishes at the Dublin Novice XC Championships today in Tymon Park.

It was great to see so many athletes out representing the club in very blustery conditions.

Thanks as always to the officials for organising and to our club supporters for bringing along the tent and cheering the athletes along around the course.

5th Women's Team led home by Jen Preston in 7th position.

5th Men's Team with Mark Naylor first home in 22nd position.
