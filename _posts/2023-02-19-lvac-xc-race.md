Our Club XC Championships took place in the Phoenix Park. Women and M65+ ran 2 laps around the Dog Pond course while it was 10k or 4 laps for the Men.

The men's race proved to be an exciting affair with David Carroll taking the gold over the last lap of 4 in the 10k race. It was a tight finish with Geoffrey Alexandre taking silver and Sergei Dolgy taking bronze. 

The women's race also had a close finish with Mollie O'Donnel having led from the gun holding off a strong finishing Rebecca McLoughlin to take gold. Brigid Reilly was not far behind in third place. 

Congratulations to all our athletes and as always a big thank you to the officials for making the race happen.
