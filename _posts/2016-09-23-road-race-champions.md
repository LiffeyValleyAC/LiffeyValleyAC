### Sile Carroll and Peter Arthur Win Club Road Championships

Previous editions of the Myles Cullen and George Harrison Trophy races
encountered wet and windy conditions but Sundays (18/09/16) weather was ideal
with virtually no breeze and only some short misty showers .

Peter Arthurâ€™s winning time of 32.21 was a course record and 1m47s faster than
his winning time last year. Peter had Damien Cauvet for company in the early
stages but by halfway reached in 16m08 he had begun to open a gap and looks
like on the basis of this performance he will be able to translate his
excellent track racing to the upcoming cross country season. Damien also ran
faster than ever before taking the silver medal and had the added bonus of
winning the Myles Cullen Trophy awarded on the basis of a sealed handicap.

Arnoud Benjacar took the bronze medal.

Sile Carroll is another athlete coming off a fine track season and she had a
marginal personal best for the distance as she added the road championship to
the other club titles in cross country and track she won earlier in the year.

Aileen Gittens also ran a fine race to take the silver medal with Eimear Nic An
Bhaird also displaying some good early season form to finish third. Sile had
quite a successful day as she won the George Harrison Trophy awarded on the
basis of a sealed handicap.
