Liffey Valley’s women’s team won the Leinster Senior team title for the first time in Dunboyne on Sunday last.

In a race which was combined with the Celtic International Sarah Mulligan made her intentions clear from the start by taking the field along with Leona O’Reilly leading the Liffey Valley squad followed by Sile Carroll, Aileen Gittens, Siobhan Keenehan, recovering from influeneza but out to help the team, Eimear Nic An Bhaird and Ger Feely.

On the second circuit Leona made some progress as she overhauled some of the early leaders and Aileen worked her way through with Eimear rediscovering some of last seasons form to move into the fourth scorer position.

The course is deceptively testing with a few moderate climbs and Leona lead the team home in 4th position in the championship with Aileen next in 7th. place followed by Sile in 9th. Eimear 10th. Siobhan 16th. and Ger 19th. for a comprehensive win over Tullamore Harriers.

Leona and Aileen had the added bonus of scoring on the Dublin’s winning county team finishing with two gold medals each.
The women’s team has now won Leinster Novice, Intermediate and Senior titles over the last two seasons quite some achievement.
The men’s team finished in fourth place lead home by Damian in 11th. place followed by Peter 18th. Chris 22nd. with Mike completing the scoring in 35th. position.
Ciaran in 37th. Gavin 49th.and Brendan in 64th completed the scoring.
Fine running from the team some of who were competing at this level for the first time.
