It seems like our runners have to brave the weather each time they head
out onto the track. This Wednesday was no different but through the rain
and wind our athletes persevered.

Peter continued his fine track season with another win at the Dublin Board
Graded Track Meeting at Morton Stadium when winning the Grade A 5000 Mtrs
in a time of 14mins 52 secs. Just one second off his Personal Best set in
May of 14 mins 51 secs.

From the gun three athletes broke away including Peter, Colin Maher from
Laois and former Olympian Mark Kenneally of Clonliffe Hrs. The trio passed
1K in 2mins 55 secs with steady laps of 70/71 secs. After seven laps Maher
broke away as Kenneally and Peter passed 3K In a time of 8mins 52 secs.
Maher was then reeled in with Peter and Kenneally pushing on ahead before
Peter took over with 400 Mtrs to go to win in a time of 14mins 52 secs from
Hughes of Monaghan who posted 14mins 55 the same time as Kenneally in third
spot.

Not to be outdone by Peter Pierce Geoghegan broke new ground when clocking
15 mins 37 secs for a New Personal Best to follow on his new PBS over 1500
and 3000Mtrs earlier in the season.
 
Sile Muldowney and Sinead McDonald came in 3rd and 4th in the Grade AB1
800m race. Times are not really interesting, given the conditions, but the
up-and-coming Sinead is soon going to be challenging the tactical prowess
of our lead runner Sile. Watch this space!

Jen Preston had a strong run in the B grade race and Brigid O'Reilly is
pushing ahead in her first ever track season in the  C grade race. Both
of these runners have improved substantially over the track season, in all
sorts of conditions and undoubtedly this will hold them in good stead for
the races in the rest of the year.
