location: Kilmacow

Old Style or “real cross country” was in evidence in rain drenched Kilmacow on Sunday January 17th for the Leinster Senior Cross Country Championships.
But it did not prevent Peter Arthur record his first ever championship win with a very impressive piece of front running as he left the field trailing in his wake to win by 50 seconds.

Peter was always in the leading group and began opening a gap on his pursuers which included Damian Cauvet who was engaged in the battle for the silver medal for a long part of the race.

Once Peter went in front he continued to extend his lead right to the tape.
Damian ran a fine race to finish third with Darren Spring in 8th and Chris Morgan moving through to 13th.
Sean Dowling was next in 18th and John Parker completed the squad in 25th position.

Liffey Valley had 14 points to spare on Celbridge with Sliabh Buidhe third.

Peter collected three gold medals his individual winners medal, the club team and led the Dublin team to victory where Darren, Chris and Sean also scored.

Leona O’Reilly took over at the front of the women’s 5k from an early stage and looked to be on her way to victory entering the last 200 metres but the fast finishing St.Abban’s athlete Mary Ann O’Sullivan came down the finish funnel like the proverbial train to snatch victory by the tightest of margins.

Leona lead the team to the silver medals with Eimear Nic An Bhaird 10th, Sile Carroll 12th, Alvy Carragher 20th and Annie Gittens 24th.

Leona led the Dublin team to victory in the inter county race whilst Sile helped Kilkenny to a bronze medal.
