title: Clean sweep for LVAC at Leinster Novice XC
location: Avondale Forest Park, Co. Wicklow
---

The rolling hills of Avondale Forest Park provided Liffey Valley with one of its most successful days at Leinster Championships .The dry underfoot conditions were ideal and the Novice menâ€™s team were first in action and Damian Cauvet, Peter Arthur and Chris Morgan positioned themselves well in the leading pack as the first of three by 2k circuits were completed.

Damian hung on to the leading bunch for some time before the highly impressive Thomas Moran took over at the front and pulled away. Damian was involved in the battle for 5th and 6th for a considerable part of the race whilst Peter Arthur was trying to consolidate his place in the first ten followed closely by Chris Morgan. Meanwhile Gavin Curran was battling away in the twenties as fourth scorer. It was evident from early that the team was between Liffey Valley and Dublin Novice Champions Donore.

The finish straight was uphill and Damian was just edged out of 6th. Meanwhile Peter was in 10th one place ahead of Chris and Gavin completed the scoring in 31st. with Stephen Corri in his first cross country season having a good run in 55th.

A points total of 59 was 17 better than Donore to ensure team victory whilst Damian, Peter and Chris scored for the Dublin winning team in the inter county competition.
