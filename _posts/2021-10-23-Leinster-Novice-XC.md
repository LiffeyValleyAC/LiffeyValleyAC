Fantastic racing by our novice women at the Leinster Novice Championships at Mountain View Golf Club, Co. Kilkenny with a strong 5th place finish. Well done all on a great performance.

A special shout out to all the supporters who made there way to Kilkenny to cheer on the team and to Tom McCormack for bringing the tent.
