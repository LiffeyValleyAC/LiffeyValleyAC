title: Dublin Athletics Graded Meeting 8
---
The final Graded Meet of the season saw our athletes racing over the mile and 3000m. It was a perfect night for racing in Lucan as thankfully the rain held off. We had a win, some PBs and a SBs to round off the track season for another year.

The best Liffey Valley performance of this meet came from SÃ­le Muldowney who won the women's Mile Race with a sprint down the finish straight to leave her pursuers trailing in her wake.

Geoffrey, Sergei and Keith all ran new personal bests in the 3000m to finish off a great season.

Thanks to all our supporters who cheered everyone throughout the season and also to the officials for organising a very successful Dublin Graded Meetinsg Series..
