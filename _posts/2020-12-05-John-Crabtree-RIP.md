The club are sorry to hear the news of the passing of former member John Crabtree.

John was a member of the club from the beginning having previously being a member of
Avondale Athletic Club prior to the formation of Liffey Valley in 1976.

He competed for the club for many years and was an important member
of successful club teams in the late 70s and mid eighties. He was a Marathon specialist
and he won the Dublin County Marathon title in the late 1970s. He also ran in the Dublin
City Marathon in the early eighties and has a personal best of 2Hrs 35 Mins for the
distance.

Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time.
