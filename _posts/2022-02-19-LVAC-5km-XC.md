Lots of smiles for our Club 5km XC race in the Phoenix Park despite the cold and the wind. 

We had a great turn out today. A special congratulations to Sean O Malley who claimed top points for the Winter League and to John Touhy in second and Siobhan Nuguent in 3rd. 

The next race in our Winter League will be our Club XC Championships on the 13th of March.

A special thank you to all the officials who braved the elements to make the race happen.
