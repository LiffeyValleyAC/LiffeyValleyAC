Sile and Peter Arthur retained their club championships titles in ideal cross country conditions,
with moderate breeze and firm underfoot conditions.

Sile and Eimear Nic An Bhaird had a good battle over 5k for most of the way with Sile pulling away
over the latter stages of the race to win by 4 seconds.

Jen Preston had a quite a race to overcome Sinead McDonald to win the bronze medal.

Peter Arthur set about retaining his title from the start and lost no time in moving to the front
to dominate the race. Chris Morgan and Gaetan Le Page headed the chasing pack.

Chris took the silver and Ciaran Reilly made steady progress throughout the race to move into third
place ahead of the fast finishing Matt Blyth.
