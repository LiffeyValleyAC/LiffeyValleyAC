title: Liffey Valley AC placed 3rd in National 5K Championships
location: Phoenix Park, Dublin
---
The National 5K Road Championships was held in conjunction with the Irish
Runner 5K. 1100 runners took part in this event which marks the first race
in the Athletics Ireland Race Series. It was a fine day for a race, with a 
bit of a breeze and a chill but nothing to stop our runners achiving some
of their all time best results.

Peter Arthur continues his strong form following his National 10K personal 
best (and 4th place finish) with a 5K personal best and a 3rd place National
Seniors finish. The middle ranks were well supported by club stalwarts, 
Ciaran Reilly and Paul Balfe, each coming in the the 17 minute range. The 
final scoring team member was Anthony Mc Mahon, getting another personal best
after the National 10K, and continuing his well earned development over the
2018/2019 season.
 
Conor Reilly had a good run only avoiding scoring by a few seconds. Brigid
Reilly did not manage to get her third PB over this distance this season and
Steven Coughlan is continuing his recovery from injury. 

Overall, the Liffey Valley team was placed 3rd, an excellent start to the 
summer season for the club.
