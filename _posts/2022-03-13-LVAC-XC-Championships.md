We had a fantastic turnout for our Club XC Championships in the Phoenix Park. The course was soft but at least the rain held off! 

There was a close battle for gold in the men's 10km race with Geoffrey Alexandre narrowly beating Sergei Dolgy in a sprint finish. Tom O Connor had a strong race to finish third. 

The women's race was also a great race with many women racing cross country for the first time. Sin√©ad McDonald secured her first club XC title, followed home by Mollie O'Donnell in 2nd and Siobhan Nuguent in 3rd. 

Well done to all athletes and a big thank you to all the officials who made the race possible.
