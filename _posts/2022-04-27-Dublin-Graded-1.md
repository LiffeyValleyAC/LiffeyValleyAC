title: Dublin Athletics Graded Meeting 1 
---
It was a great start to a new track season at Tallaght Athletic Club

There was a huge turn out of Liffey Valley AC athletes for the first track race of the season yesterday evening in Tallaght. 

Eight of our women competed over 800m. This was a track debut for some of the woman on what was a great night for racing. 

We had two men competing over 800m and three over 3000m and they all put in some solid performances

Well done to all our athletes on the first track race of the season we had some PBs and will hopefully have a lot more to come over the Summer.
