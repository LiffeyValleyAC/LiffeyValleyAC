ðŸ¥ˆLeinster Intermediate SilverðŸ¥ˆ

ðŸ¥ˆ A fantastic team effort by our women to take silver in the Leinster Intermediate XC Championships. This silver medal sees the team improve on their bronze place finish from last year and back up their Dublin intermediate silver medal from a few weeks ago. It just shows that all those Winter miles really do pay off! 

It was great to see 7 of our women making the trip to Wicklow. Looking forward to the next race! 

Our men's team finished 6th and was led home by Geoffrey who finished in 11th.
