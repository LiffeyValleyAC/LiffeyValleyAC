location: Tyrellspass, Co. Westmeath

On a deceptively testing course at The New Forest Golf Course in Tyrellspass,
Co. Westmeath, the women’s team continued their fine record in Leinster Cross
Country Championships by winning the Senior Team Title for the second time.

New Club Captain Eimear Nic An Bhaird showed leadership in the early stages as
she led the squad through the first small loop. Sile Carroll moved up, followed
by Aileen Gittens. Denise Fitzgerald and Ciara Broderick Farrell, running in
their first senior championship, were battling for team positions as the field
went out on the first of the two longer laps which included some testing small
climbs.

With Sile, Aileen and Eimear in the first ten the team were in a very
strong position, ably backed up by Ciara and Denise. On the last lap
Aileen made progress to lead the team home in 7th place and also score on the
Dublin team.

Eimear came next in 11th, enjoying her best ever run at this level, followed
by Sile in 12th. Ciara was the fourth scorer followed by Denise, both having
fine runs at what was for them a high level of competition for newcomers and
indicating some good running to come in the future.

The scoring total of 62 points was 13 better than Tullamore’s 75 with Kilmore
third on 85.

The women’s team has a fine record in Leinster starting with a Novice,
Intermediate double team titles in 2013. Moving up a level in 2014 to finish
second in the Senior event and going one better in 2015 by winning the Senior
in Dunboyne. Silver medals were the result in January last. They should also
be in the history books since for the first time due to the restructuring of
the cross country season we had the unique situation of two Leinster Senior
Championships being run in the same calendar year.

In the men’s race Peter Arthur in 5th place led the team home to 4th
place and also led the Dublin team to victory in the inter county team race.
