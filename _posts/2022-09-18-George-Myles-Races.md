title: Club 5k & 10k Road Championships and George Harrison and Myles Cullen Trophies.
---

<p>It was beautiful summer/autumn day in the Phoenix Park which saw the return of the George Harrison and Myles Cullen Memorial Races. There was a great turn out with 24 athletes, race officals, members and friends in attendance. 

The races take place every September in memory of two past members of the club and are a great warm up for the XC season.</p> 

<p>Congratulations to Mollie O'Donnell and Peter Arthur in winning the championships, while Siobhan Nugent and Paul Balfe have the honour of winning the George Harrison and Myles Cullen Trophies.</p>
