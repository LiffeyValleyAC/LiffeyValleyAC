The club were sad to hear of the passing of former clubman David Cunningham
who was a member of the club in the late seventies and early eighties. Davy was
a very talented athlete and who ran for Dunboyne Athletic Club as a Junior and 
won the Leinster Junior Cross country title along with other championships at 
800 Mtrs, 1500 mtrs 5000 mtrs and Steeplechase.

He joined Liffey Valley in the late seventies improving further and was a vital part
of successful teams for a number of years over Road, Cross Country and Track.
Davy was a great competitor who never shirked a challenge when he donned the 
club singlet which he wore with pride on so many occasions. When he retired he retained
a great interest in how the clubs athletes and teams were performing up to the current day.

Coming from a family steeped in athletics his son Richard was also a talented athlete
who competed for the club for a number of years with success in early 2000s.

All our lives will be the poorer of the loss of Davy particularly his wife Betty and his
son Richard and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this sad time.
