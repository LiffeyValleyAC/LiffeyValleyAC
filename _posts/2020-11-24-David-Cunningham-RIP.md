Liffey Valley A.C. have lost one of our stalwart members with the sad news today of the death of David Cunningham. 

In the early years of the club in the late seventies and early eighties once David put on the club vest whether it was 800m on track or 12000m on a hilly muddy course he could be relied upon to get the best out of himself. 

Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Betty and son Richard at ths sad time.
May he rest in peace.
