Sile Carroll and Damian Cauvet won their respective races on a pleasant evening in ALSAA with contrasting tactical approaches.

Sile was happy to control the race from the front with Aileen and Lena for company through an opening lap of 76secs. With 300 to go Sile started to pull away and Aileen tried to respond but Sile powered away to cover the second lap 3 seconds faster than the first one and win from Aileen who ran a personal best to win her first club championship medal with Lena third. Annie Gittens running her first ever track race gave an indication of her potential in fourth place with a gritty run.

Damian employed his usual positive approach to proceedings as he took the race along from the front with Peter Arthur trying to hang on followed by Mike Griffin and Ciaran Reilly.
While Damian powered on to victory Peter was overhauled by Ciaran and Mike who had a great battle down the straight with Mike having the best finish to take silver with Ciaran third.

With 23 athletes in action it was necessary to run two races with Conor Reilly winning the second one ahead of Tony Dunne and John Cullen.
