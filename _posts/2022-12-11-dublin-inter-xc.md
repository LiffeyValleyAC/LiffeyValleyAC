Congratulations to our Women's team on their fantastic silver place finish in the Dublin Intermediate Championship. As seen from this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CmCP-JKOR5I/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip (courtesy of MyRun Results</a> this was another battling performance by our athletes, led home by Ciara in 6th, Siobh√°n in 9th and Brigid in 10th. 

Well done also to our Men who narrowly missed out on bronze medals. They finished fourth just one point off third place. 

Fantastic running by all our athletes in very challenging conditions!
