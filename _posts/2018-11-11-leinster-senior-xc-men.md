In Adamstown on Sunday last Nov 11th Peter Arthur in 3rd place and Pierce Geoghegan
in 4th spot led the club team to Silver Team Medals in the Leinster Senior Cross
country Championships on a tough course on wet and windy day which was a real test
for the athletes involved.

From the gun eventual winner Liam Brady set a hot pace closely followed by Sean Hehir
of Rathfarnham with Peter and Pierce in close attendance. Both Peter and Pierce were
closing the gap on Hehir who ran for Ireland in the recent European Marathon as the
pace upfront was unrelenting as the race progressed.

Peter and Pierce never gave up the chase on Hehir as he opened up a Large gap on the
following runners which laid the foundation for the club success with Chris, Ciaran,
Gaeten, and Matt all gaining places as the race progressed to secure vital points for
the team.

After 7 tough laps on a hilly course Peter came home in 3rd place to win the bronze
individual medal while Pierce in 4th place led the Dublin team to gold medals with
Chris also scoring for the successful Dublin team.

This result follows on the club's recent great record in this race with Liffey Valley
teams finishing in the top two places every year for the last three years to confirm
our standing as one of the top distance running clubs in Leinster
