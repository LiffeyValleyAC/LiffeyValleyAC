Congratulations to all our athletes on a great day of racing at the Dublin Marathon yesterday.

Whether it was a debut marathon or the latest of many it is fair to say that it is a great achievement to race over 26.2 miles. We are all very proud of the hard work and dedication shown by our athletes over the last few months. Well done to all!
