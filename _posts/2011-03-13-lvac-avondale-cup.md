Congratulations to John Parker who is the winner of the 53rd Avondale Cup race, holding off Paul Power and John Cullen. On a very cold but dry spring morning, 38 athletes lined took off on the 4 mile lap around the bicycle track of the 15 acres.  

Thanks to Stephen Coughlan, Gerry O'Reilly, Jimmy Monaghan, Tom McCormack and Dermot Ryan for officiating on a very cold day and Jim and Nick for getting the handicaps spot on (except the Powerpack!)
