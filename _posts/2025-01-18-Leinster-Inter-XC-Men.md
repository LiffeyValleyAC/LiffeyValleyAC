Amazing performance from the entire squad today! 🏅 The hard work and teamwork really paid off, with fantastic results across the board:

▶️ Pierce set the pace by taking 1st place in the Masters' category and in his individual category!<br>
▶️ Mark secured 2nd in the Intermediate, while also leading the team to Silver medals.<br>
▶️ A big shoutout to Mark and Geoffrey, who shone as part of the Dublin team that brought home Gold!<br>
▶️ The Masters team fought hard, finishing 4th and just two points shy of Bronze—a testament to their incredible effort.<br>

This is a clear example of what we can achieve when we come together and give our best. Let’s keep building on this momentum—great things are ahead. Well done, everyone! 👏🏃🏽‍♂️
