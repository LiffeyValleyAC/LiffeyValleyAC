The National 10K Road Championships which incorporated the Great Ireland
Run drew a field of over 4000 athletes with a large number from the club
taking part on a cold and windy day that was not conducive to fast times
on newly designed course.

Pride of place goes to Peter Arthur in 4th place with a new Personal Best of
of 31mins 16 secs which saw him only beaten for the Bronze medal position in
the last few strides after a very strong finish.
 
Next up for the team was Pierce Geoghegan who also recorded a new PB of
32mins 38 secs in 22nd place while Gaeten Le Page in 36m 13 and Anthony
Mc Mahon 37mins 38 secs also broke new ground with personal bests for the 
distance.

The club senior team also performed excellently to finish in 4th place in
the Senior team event while the Masters team were 12th in their category.
