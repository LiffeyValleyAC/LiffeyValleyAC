title: National Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships
location: Castlelyons, Co. Cork

Another great days racing for the club at the Athletics Ireland Intermediate and Masters XC Championships in Co.Cork. The course was soft underfoot and provided a real challenge for all the athletes. 

ðŸ¥‰Tom O Connor had strong run to finish 3rd M60.
ðŸ¥‡Arnaud Benjacar was a scoring member of the Dublin gold winning team.

Our men's M50 narrowly missed out on medals finishing in 4th position. 

Our women's intermediate team finished 5th. It was one of our largest ever teams for the National Intermediate Championships with 9 athletes competing for the club.
