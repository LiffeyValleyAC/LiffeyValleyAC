Last weeks graded meeting at Tallaght saw many fine performances from the athletes involved
with Peter Arthur and Damien Cauvet leading the way with a one and two in the Dublin
3000 Mtrs Championships with training partner Neil O Rourke of Civil Service in third spot.

Peter, Damian and Neil set the pace from the gun with an opening lap of 66 secs which saw
this trio move away from the field and share the pacemaking before Peter drew away on
the last lap to take the gold medal with Damian and Neil also finishing strongly. Peter finishing
time was 8 mins 37.87 secs, Damian 8 mins 42.56 sec and Neil 8 mins 51.39 which is a new Personal
Best. Also competing over 3K were Arnaud Benjacar 9 mins 51.02 for 7th in grade while Matt Blyth
broke new ground with 10 mins 18.35.

21.26 for 7th place, while Aileen Gittens in Grade B ran 2mins 32.7 secs for 8th place.
