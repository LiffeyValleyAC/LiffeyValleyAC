It was a good afternoon for Liffey Valley in the rolling hills of Ballyroan Co. Laois as the women’s team continued their great season taking silver in the team championship with the means squad finishing in the bronze medal position.

A testing 2k course which included a few hills provided a challenge for all and the women’s 5k saw Raheny's Aoife Talty dominate the race with Leona contesting the silver and bronze medals positions for some of the race. While Leona was battling away at the front the next scoring places were being contested by all the team, the essence of good team running.

At the finish Leona was 5th. with Eimear in 19th. the first time she occupied the second scoring position on the team. Lena in 20th just held off the fast finishing Síle and Aileen was just three places behind with Siobhan not having one of her better days in 27th.
Leona was also on the Dublin winning team so gold and silver on the day.
It has been quite a season for the women’s team in Leinster winning the Novice and Intermediate titles and adding the Silver at Senior level a remarkable achievement given that some of the athletes are having their first ever cross country season.

Five laps of the figure eight course was a testing 10k and Darren Spring was always hovering around the first ten from the start. Damian Cauvet ran his usual aggressive race with the smooth Mike Griffin inside the first 20 for some of the journey. With ten athletes contesting the scoring places there was some interesting battles. Darren led the team home in 9th. position, sixth scorer on the Dublin’s winning team with Damian 14th. Mike 21st with Kieran Murray making his scoring debut in 26th. the 4th scorer.

Andy Nason came next in 30th. Gavin Curran held off Sean Dowling and Ciaran Reilly, Gerry Daly and Paul Balfe completed the team.
