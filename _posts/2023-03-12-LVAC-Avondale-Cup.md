Congratulations to Patrick Fox the winner of the 2023 Avondale Cup. It is great to see one of our newer members taking a well deserved first place over 5km. It just shows that consistent training pays off!

Also notable that 5 athletes in their 70's were competing in what must be their collective 100+ Avondale Cup appearances. Our very own <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/blue-zones#:~:text=“Blue%20Zones”%20are%20geographic%20areas,more%20common%20in%20old%20age." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluezone Enclave</a> 💪🏼🏃‍♀🏃🏽

Well done to all our athletes on competing today but in particular to our other medalists.
