It seems like our runners have to brave the weather each time they head out onto the track. This Wednesday was no different
but through the rain and wind our althletes persevered. Sile Muldowney and Sinead McDonald came in 3rd and 4th in the Grade AB1
800m race. Times are not really interesting, given the conditions, but the up-and-coming Sinead is soon going to be challenging 
the tactical prowess of our lead runner Sile. Watch this space!

Jen Preston had a strong run in the B grade race and Brigid O'Reilly is pushing ahead in her first ever track season in the 
C grade race. Both of these runnners have improved substatially over the track season, in all sorts of conditions and
undoubtably this will hold them in good stead for the races in the rest of the year.

Our men runners did fairly well themselves with Peter Arthur winning the 5000m in 14m52.00s and Pierce Geoghegen maintaining
fine form for the season in getting 15m37.10s in the same race and holding on to 12th position.
