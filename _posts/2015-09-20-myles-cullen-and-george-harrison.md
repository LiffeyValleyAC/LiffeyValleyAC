The 2015 edition of the LVAC 10km (men’s) and 5Km (women’s) championship took
place in perfect conditions on the Acres lap. The club championship, which
incorporates the Myles Cullen and George Harrison memorial trophies was a
keenly contested event with many battles taking places in both races.

Leona O’Reilly led home the women’s race in a time of 18:22 followed by a very strong
run from Aileen Gittens who is coming back into some fine form. Síle Carroll
completed the medal winners for the womens.

Peter Arthur ran a strong race in
34:09 leading from the gun to tape. Brendan Beere finished second (35.05) and
Ciaran Reilly and Chris Morgan battled it out on the last lap with positions
altering coming into the final stretch and Ciaran emerged victorious to grab
bronze.

Well done to all new members who competed the tough lap and some fine
performances were evident in both races. Presentations of the club championship
medals and the memorial trophies took place after the race in Gael Scoil
Inchicore with members of the Harrison and Cullen family in attendance.
