It was another fantastic turnout from both officals and athletes as 31 took to the line. There was a small matter of the Winter League to conclude with this race also.

By the end, Joe Cooper had wrapped up the Winter League in style as he held on to win the 2 mile race on a lovey spring evening.

Fastest times on the night belonged to Lea, Sergei and David Van Buren, with Sinead McDonald posting the fastest women's time in her last LVAC club race.

Well done to all athletes and a big thank you to all the officials for organising a great race.
