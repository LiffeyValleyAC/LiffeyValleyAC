The 2018 edition of the LVAC 10km (men’s) and 5Km (women’s) championship took
place in blustery conditions on the Acres lap. The club championship, which
incorporates the Myles Cullen and George Harrison memorial trophies was a
keenly contested event with many battles taking places in both races.

Aileen Gittens led home the women's race in a time of 19:45 followed by 
Síle Carrroll. Jen Preston completed the medal winners, claiming her first
ever club medal. Lauryn Sullivan was the winner of the George Harrison trophy.

Peter Arthur claimed victory in the men's race, a clear winner in 34:00 with
Paul Balfe second in 36:45 closely follwed by Chris Morgan in 36:59. In his
first ever club race Sergei Dolgy was a clear winner of the Myles Cullen trophy.

Well done to all new members who competed the tough lap in testing conditions with
some fine performances evident in both races. Presentations of the club championship
medals and the memorial trophies took place after the race in Gael Scoil
Inchicore with members of the Harrison and Cullen family in attendance.
