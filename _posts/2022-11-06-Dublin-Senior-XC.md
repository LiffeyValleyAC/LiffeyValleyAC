title: 5th for LVAC Teams at Dublin Senior XC
location: Citywest, Dublin
---

Congratulations to both our teams for placing 5th place at the Dublin Senior XC Championships in Citywest.

The conditions were good if soft underfoot for the women's 6km race but the skies opened just in time for the men's 10km race making it all the more challenging. 🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️

Well done to all athletes for representing the club. It is always great to have teams competing at the top level.

Thank you as always to our supporters and to Tom McCormick for putting up the tent.
