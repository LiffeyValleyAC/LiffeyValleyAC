---

Running off virtual scratch Damien Cauvet set a new course record of 19m36secs.
To win the Avondale Cup four mile road race ahead of Paul Quinn and John Tuohy
who both ran faster than previously on this circuit.

A pleasant spring Sunday morning on the two lap circuit in the Phoenix Park
provided an opportunity for some good racing. As the handicap unfolded after
the first lap Linda Spratt, Joe Cooper and John Tuohy were making progress
towards the front. Last year’s winner Eimear Nic An Bhaird was also among
those going out on the second lap who looked like they could have a say in the
destination of the trophy.

Meanwhile Damien with a very aggressive piece of running was overhauling many
of those who started ahead of him as the race entered the last mile. With
Winter League points also to be gained every place was vital.

Damien moved ahead on the Furze Road approaching the finish to win by a
convincing 44 seconds ahead of Paul Quinn with John Tuohy holding off the
scratch man Peter Arthur, who also dipped under 20 minutes, to finish fourth.

Sile Carroll ran faster than before to record the fastest women’s time of 24m31s
six seconds faster than Eimear Nic An Bhaird who was also faster than her winning
time of last year.
