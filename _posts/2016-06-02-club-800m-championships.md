Sile Carroll and Peter Arthur won the club 800 metres titles at ALSAA on June
2nd. Sile’s winning time of 2.23.1 was a championship best performance with
Peter dipping under 2 minutes again as he retained his title.

There was an interesting battle for the second and third positions in the
women’s race as Aileen and Annie Gittens had quite a race with Aileen holding
on for the silver medal ahead of her sister to become the first sisters to win
medals in the club championships.

Damian Cauvet ran a personal best to take silver in the men’s ahead of former
winner Ciaran Reilly.
