title: Liffey Valley 1500/3000m Club Race
location: ALSAA, Dublin

This Thursday evening just gone saw our athletes competing against each other in the
club 1500m for women and 3000m for men. The track was wet and the weather was not great and
while this may have affected the times, it did not dampen the spirits of our hardened athletes. 

Sile fought a tactical race with up-and-coming Sinead McDonald over 1500m and just pipped her
in the last few meters by 0.3 seconds getting 5 minutes, 06.2 seconds. In 3rd place was Aileen
Arthur with 5 minutes and 21.3 seconds. Aileen was up with the first 2 for much of the race, but 
only just coming back from injury meant she fell back a little in the final lap.

The mens' race was won by Peter Arthur getting 8 minutes and 42 seconds over 3000m. This was
well ahead of the next two places at 10 minutes 07.2 seconds for Eoin, a new club member, and
Paul Balfe, an old hand, on 10 minutes 09.5 seconds. A close contest between these guys and an
enjoyable race to watch, given the conditions.
